Based on the trace, the issue is in the `additionalProperties` function in `jsonschema/_keywords.py` where there's a `NotImplementedError` that needs to be removed and the actual implementation needs to be uncommented. Here's the diff:

 def additionalProperties(validator, aP, instance, schema):
     if not validator.is_type(instance, "object"):
         return
-    raise NotImplementedError("TODO remove me")
 
     extras = set(find_additional_properties(instance, schema))
 
```

The diff removes the `NotImplementedError` line while keeping the rest of the function implementation intact. The line numbers and context match exactly with what's shown in the trace (Block 9, lines 36-39).
